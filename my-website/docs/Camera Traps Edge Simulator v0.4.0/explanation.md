# Explanation

## Architectual Overview

This application uses the [event-engine](https://github.com/tapis-project/event-engine) library to implement its plugin architecture and event-driven communication.  The engine uses [zmq](https://zeromq.org/) sockets to deliver events between senders and the subscribers interested in specific events.

The event-engine supports *internal* and *external* plugins.  Internal plugins are Rust plugins delivered with camera-traps and run in the camera-traps process.  External plugins are configured by camera-traps to run outside the camera-traps process and use a TCP port to send and receive events.  By using TCP, external plugins can be written in any language that supports the [flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) wire protocol.
