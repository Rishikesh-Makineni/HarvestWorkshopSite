# camera-traps

The camera-traps application is both a simulator and an edge device application for classifying images, with the first deployment specializing in wildlife images.  The simulation environment will be implemented first and serve as a test bed for protocols and techniques that optimize storage, execution time, power and accuracy.  The ultimate goal is to deploy a version of this application on camera-trap devices in the wild.
