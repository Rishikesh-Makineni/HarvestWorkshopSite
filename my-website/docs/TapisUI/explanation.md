# Explanation
TapisUI provides a research oriented frontend to interact with Tapis and tenant components. In this case, the ICICLE extension extends TapisUI with custom branding 
and integration with other ICICLE components such as CKN, FASS, Camera Traps, and more. The extension's `/src/index.ts` file registers the extension and implements the code in `/src`.
The main TapisUI repository on deployment ensures it installs this extension.
