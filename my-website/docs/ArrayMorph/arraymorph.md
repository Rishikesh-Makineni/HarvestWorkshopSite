# Arraymorph

ArrayMorph is a software to manage array data stored on cloud object storage efficiently. It supports both HDF5 C++ API and h5py API. The data returned by h5py API is numpy arrays. By using h5py API, users can access array data stored on the cloud and feed the read data into machine learning pipelines seamlessly.
