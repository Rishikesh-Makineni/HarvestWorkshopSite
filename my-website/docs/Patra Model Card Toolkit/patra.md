# Patra Model Card Toolkit

The Patra Toolkit is a component of the Patra ModelCards framework designed to simplify the process of creating and documenting AI/ML models. It provides a structured schema that guides users in providing essential information about their models, including details about the model's purpose, development process, and performance. The toolkit also includes features for semi-automating the capture of key information, such as fairness and explainability metrics, through integrated analysis tools. By reducing the manual effort involved in creating model cards, the Patra Toolkit encourages researchers and developers to adopt best practices for documenting their models, ultimately contributing to greater transparency and accountability in AI/ML development.
