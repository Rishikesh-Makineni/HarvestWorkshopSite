# Characterizing and Modeling AI-Driven Animal Ecology Studies at the Edge

This repo provides instructions for extracting workload information from AI-Driven Animal Ecology (ADAE) studies.
We also provide instructions for modelling ADAE studies as time-varying Poisson arrival rates.
These simulated workloads can be used to test different scaling techniques (independent and correlated) and validate edge computing systems for ADAE studies in the field.
