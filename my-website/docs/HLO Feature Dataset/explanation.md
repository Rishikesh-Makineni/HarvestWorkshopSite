# Explanation

- This dataset captures both **tabular metadata** and **graph representations** from deep learning training workflows, extracted via TensorFlow's XLA compiler.
- Designed within the AI4CI thrust of ICICLE, it supports experiments in:
  - AI for Systems (AI4Sys)
  - Smart scheduling in HPC
  - Graph-based workload characterization
- The combination of static metadata and dynamic graph structures enables hybrid ML approaches.
