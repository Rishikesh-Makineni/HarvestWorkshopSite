# PEFT Vision

## Lessons and Insights from a Unifying Study of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in Visual Recognition
 
### A Systematic Framework for Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) in Visual Recognition 

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention lately due to the increasing size of pre-trained models and the need to fine-tune them for superior downstream performance. This community-wide enthusiasm has
sparked a plethora of approaches. We provide a systematic and comprehensive code base implementing 16 PEFL methods, which serves as a valuable resource for researchers and enables **consistent and reproducible evaluations** of PEFT methods. We conduct a unifying empirical study of 16 representative PEFT approaches in **various scenarios**, including low shots, many shots, different domain gaps, and robustness between in-distribution and OOD. Our findings offer several insightful directions for future research, including **leveraging prediction differences** in other learning paradigms such as semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation, **robust fine-tuning with PEFT**, and  providing **empirical evidence for PEFT mechanism understanding**.
